# permalink.js

Creates permalinks on existing sites and jumps to them

## Usage

For now, just link your site to permalink.js and it'll create `id`s for all the heading elements, and anchor points.

It might be too much for your linking, and you might want to narrow the selector (to perhaps just the `article` element).

The nice thing about this is it will allow people to jump to specific headings and share those as real links. Which gives you a little more time to implement server side `id`s against the headings :)

## TODO

Lots...
